This is my first GitHub repository.

In this project, I built, secured, and customized a web application using Azure and GoDaddy services, refining my skills in cloud computing, security, and web management. I started by creating an Azure web app and deployed a Docker container to host my cyber blog. This involved selecting service plans, setting up the environment, and managing cloud resources.

Next, I registered a custom domain through GoDaddy and mapped it to my Azure app via DNS settings, giving my web application a professional web address.

A key part of the project was securing the web application using SSL/TLS certificates. I first created a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL and then explored Azure's Managed Certificates for stronger security, integrating them with Azure Key Vault to ensure encrypted traffic.

To further protect my app, I configured an Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF). I created custom rules to manage traffic, including blocking specific countries. By working with managed and custom rules, I learned how to defend against threats like SQL injection and XSS.

I also used Azure Security Center to assess and remediate vulnerabilities by reviewing security recommendations and improving my appâ€™s security.

Throughout the project, I applied cloud and cybersecurity skills such as:

Azure App Services for cloud management.
SSL/TLS encryption with self-signed and managed certificates.
DNS management for domain mapping.
WAF configuration to filter traffic and secure the application.
Container deployment using Docker.
Security monitoring via Azure Security Center.

This project gave me hands-on experience in deploying and securing web apps, emphasizing encryption, firewall protection, and certificate management.
